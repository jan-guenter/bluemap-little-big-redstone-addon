# Add-on execution

This repository starts inactive and stock-safe. Implement only the smallest
observed Little Big Redstone rendering defect before staging.

Before running Gradle gates, activate a Python 3.11 or newer virtual
environment, initialize the exact development-tool, runtime-module, and
Adapter API submodules, and install the matching toolkit wheel:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive -- \
  tooling/bluemap-addon-toolkit modules/bluemap-addon-runtime \
  modules/bluemap-addon-adapter-api
python -m pip install --disable-pip-version-check --no-deps \
  --require-hashes --only-binary=:all: \
  --requirement requirements/toolkit.txt
```

The runtime submodule contributes its two artifact-admission Java sources to
this add-on at compile time. Its gitlink pins `v0.1.0-alpha.1` commit
`6c062239f2669de9d20da32dc8b5372a5653b19d`. Do not install or bundle the
runtime module JAR.

The Adapter API gitlink pins `v0.1.0-alpha.2` commit
`e81f08bc4bfbf02d810ec8949a019130e2e61634` and source tree
`2f974c9bb2ba13888d69682f86f30f58922d30eb`. Its four Java sources compile
into this add-on. Do not install or bundle its module JAR.

Use Gradle `9.6.1` for every candidate and promotion build. The settings
preflight rejects other Gradle versions because they can change generated
Gradle module metadata without changing the Java artifacts.

## Prototype

Acquire and verify the exact candidate JARs outside Git. Their Gradle
properties are:

- `-PlittleBigRedstoneJar=/path/to/little-big-redstone-1.9.8-1.21.1.jar`

Then run:

```bash
gradle --no-daemon -PbluemapSourcePath=../bluemap-backport \
  <exact-candidate-properties> clean prototypeCheck build
bash gallery/package.sh /tmp/little_big_redstone-gallery.zip
```

Deploy that JAR and gallery only to disposable staging, verify the intended
BlueMap link loads, and compare it with the matching client. Iterate from
observed defects until the owner explicitly accepts one exact staging JAR.

## Acceptance and release

Freeze that accepted JAR's functional entries once; the writer refuses to
overwrite an existing acceptance record:

```bash
bluemap-addon-toolkit jar-entries write \
  --jar /absolute/path/accepted-staging.jar \
  --entries provenance/accepted-staging-entries.sha256
```

Record the manifest in `provenance/release.json` as
`accepted_staging_entries` with exact `path`, `entry_count`, and `sha256`.
Record `visual_acceptance: true` under `owner_accepted_staging`, and record the
production JAR, sources JAR, POM and Gradle module file names, sizes and hashes
under `final_release_artifacts`.

Promote `addon_version` through a pull request, seal the accepted identities,
and run with all exact candidate properties:

```bash
gradle --no-daemon -PbluemapSourcePath=../bluemap-backport \
  <exact-candidate-properties> -PreleaseTag=v<version> \
  clean build generatePomFileForAddonPublication \
  generateMetadataFileForAddonPublication verifyReleaseCandidate
```

Merge only after final-version CI passes this gate. Create an annotated
`v<version>` tag at reviewed `main`; the release workflow independently checks
the tag, exact BlueMap checkout, accepted bytes and draft assets before making
the prerelease public. Publication never deploys to production.
